# Memory Game Project

## Table of Contents
1) You can open the game by going to my github and downloading a local copy:

2) You play the game by clicking a card and seeing if there is a match. When all the cards have a match the game is finished!
You can try to beat your time and star rating and play as many times as you would like.

3) dependencies: JavaScript



## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
